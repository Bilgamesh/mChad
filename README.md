## Features

- Log into multiple accounts on multiple forums
- Access mChat with mobile-friendly UI
- Get notifications and don't miss any conversations
- Scroll "infinitely" through archived messages

This project is work in progress and does not currently let you use all the features of mChat that are normally available in a web browser. Current experience varies depending on custom bbcodes implemented by specific forum administrators. More features and improved support for phpBB extensions will be added in the near future.
